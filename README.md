# Get Started
To get started, we need to keep all our resources ready.
So, first let’s find and choose some fonts you like.
Go to “Google Fonts”
You can filter by category
I like “Handwriting” in the categories drop down. And also select “All languages” in the languages drop down (to make sure we select fonts that support all languages)
